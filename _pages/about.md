## about me
I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Centre for Quantum Information and Communication (QuIC)](http://quic.ulb.ac.be) at the Université libre de Bruxelles, working with Ognyan Oreshkov.
I received my PhD at the University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Giulio Chiribella](https://qici.weebly.com/giulio-chiribella.html). 

<!-- My first name "Zi Xuan" is pronounced in English approximately as "zuh shwen." -->
[[curriculum vitae]](/assets/pdf/cv.pdf) (last updated August 2025).

My research interests include
- quantum supermaps with indefinite causal structure,
- quantum correlations with indefinite causal order,
- information-theoretic principles,
- limits of information processing from foundational principles of quantum mechanics.
