**Quantum supermaps** The notion of quantum supermaps provides a framework for going beyond standard quantum theory, potentially offering new insights into the long-standing problem of reconciling quantum mechanics with Einstein’s theory of relativity. Mathematically, a quantum supermap is a higher-order transformation acting on a set of quantum channels, which may not necessarily admit a realization as a causally ordered quantum circuit.

**Bistochastic quantum theory** In Ref. [^chiribella2022quantum], we characterize the set of bistochastic channels as the largest class of operations that admit input–output inversion, and we formulate operations without a definite input–output direction as supermaps on bistochastic channels. An explicit example of such an operation is the quantum time flip, which we show can outperform standard quantum circuits. In Ref. [^guo2022experimental], we report the first experimental realization of the quantum time flip in a photonic platform, demonstrating its advantages both via witness observables and through a unitary-gate discrimination game.

We further investigate the advantage provided by quantum supermaps on bistochastic communication resources in both classical and quantum communication scenarios (Ref. [^liu2023quantum]).

**Quantum violation of causal inequalities** Assuming that quantum theory holds locally and that local devices are connected via a quantum supermap leads to an analogue of Bell nonlocality in a causally indefinite setting. Remarkably, some quantum supermaps generate correlations that defy any causal explanation. In Ref. [^liu2025tsirelson], we introduce a general method to bound quantum signaling correlations between local events, deriving Tsirelson-like bounds for a broad class of causal inequalities. This offers a powerful approach for understanding the capabilities and limitations of quantum mechanics in causally indefinite frameworks.

**Research in progress** Understanding the limits of quantum information processing from foundational principles of quantum mechanics.
